    "This is a project for medium-begginers in python. It consists in creating a code that would read an inventory and iterate through it with the user's input. I decided to add more fancy stuff than the examples I've been studying have, so it feels more real and useful. The structure can be summarized as it follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **dictionaries**: This program needs two dictionaries to work: the stock from the store and the shopping list from the client.\n",
    "It is important to leave them open at the beggining.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **User**: defines the client. This can open the path to a membership area or registration. I will study that option further.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **screen**: it reads the inventory of the store. For that purpose, I created a txt version, thus the data is external to the code (this way, the store can write a simple list, they don't need to use python). \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Shopping**: this part of the code needs loops to recieve input from the user. We will ask them if they want to shop, \n",
    "if so what items, which quantity and when are they ready to stop. Later, the program will print an invoice. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> **discounts**: I added this part to work with a simple discount. If the total is equal or greater than 10, a 10% discount is applied, but only if they have the discount code. This part of the code can be expanded to more types of discounts. \n",
    "\n",
    ">>> Discount code: *JAXX*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note: I decided to divide the code in functions so I can have a clear vision and work on it sepparately. This is not necessary at all, since the program doesn't repeat actions further from some loops. However, it feels easy for me, and it might work for you too. \n",
